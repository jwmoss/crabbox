# Crabbox

Crabbox is an open source remote testbox runner for maintainers and agents. It gives a fast local loop on owned cloud capacity: provision or reuse a warm Linux box, sync the current dirty checkout, run a command remotely, stream output, and clean up.

The current implementation is a Go CLI plus a Cloudflare Worker/Durable Object coordinator. The CLI uses the coordinator for brokered Hetzner or AWS EC2 Spot leases, with direct provider calls kept as a debug fallback.

Documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). Start with [How Crabbox Works](docs/how-it-works.md) for the end-to-end mental model. The GitHub Pages site is generated from those Markdown files with a small dependency-free builder:

```sh
node scripts/build-docs-site.mjs
open dist/docs-site/index.html
```

## Install

Latest release: `0.1.0`.

```sh
brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox
crabbox --version
```

Without Homebrew, download the matching archive from the `v0.1.0` release on GitHub:

```

## How It Works

Crabbox has a small control plane and a simple data plane:

```text
developer laptop
  crabbox CLI
    |
    | HTTPS JSON API, bearer auth
    v
Cloudflare Worker
  Fleet Durable Object
    |
    | provider API
    v
Hetzner server or AWS EC2 Spot instance

developer laptop
  |
  | rsync + SSH
  v
leased runner
```

The **CLI** is the user-facing tool. It loads config from `~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml`, repo-local `crabbox.yaml` or `.crabbox.yaml`, creates a per-lease SSH key, asks the broker for a lease, waits for SSH, seeds remote Git when possible, builds a Git file-list sync manifest, skips sync when the local/remote fingerprint matches, rsyncs the current checkout, runs the requested command, streams output, and releases the lease unless `--keep` is set. SSH prefers the configured port and can fall back to port 22 during bootstrap.

The **broker** is the Cloudflare Worker at `crabbox-coordinator.steipete.workers.dev`. It authenticates requests with `CRABBOX_SHARED_TOKEN`, routes all fleet operations through a single Durable Object, and owns cloud-provider credentials. Local machines do not need AWS or Hetzner API keys for the normal path.

The **Fleet Durable Object** is the serialized scheduler and lease store. It creates lease IDs, records owner/profile/class/provider metadata, tracks expiry, and has an alarm that expires stale leases. Release and expiry both call the provider delete path for non-kept machines.

The **provider layer** provisions capacity:

- Hetzner: imports or reuses the SSH key, creates a server, applies Crabbox labels, and falls back across configured server types when quota or capacity rejects a request.
- AWS: signs EC2 Query API calls inside the Worker, imports or reuses the SSH key pair, creates or reuses the `crabbox-runners` security group, launches one-time Spot instances, tags instances/volumes/Spot requests, and falls back across broad C/M/R instance families. Direct AWS mode can use Spot placement scores across configured regions before provisioning.

The **runner** is just an Ubuntu machine bootstrapped by cloud-init. Bootstrap creates the `crabbox` user, enables SSH on port `2222`, installs Node 24, pnpm, Docker, Git, rsync, build tools, and prepares `/work/crabbox` plus shared package caches. Package installation runs through an explicit retrying bootstrap script so transient Ubuntu mirror errors do not strand the machine. It does not need broker credentials.

The normal lifecycle is:

1. `crabbox run --class standard -- <command>` loads local config.
2. CLI sends `POST /v1/leases` with provider, class, TTL, idle timeout, slug, SSH public key, and bootstrap options.
3. Worker creates a Hetzner server or AWS Spot instance and stores the lease metadata, including `lastTouchedAt` and idle expiry.
4. CLI waits for `crabbox-ready` over SSH.
5. CLI seeds remote Git when possible, then rsyncs tracked plus nonignored untracked files into `/work/crabbox/<lease>/<repo>`.
6. CLI records sync fingerprints, enforces sync size/time guardrails, runs sync sanity checks, and hydrates configured base-ref history.
7. CLI runs the command over SSH and returns the remote exit code.
8. CLI releases the lease unless it was kept; kept leases still auto-release after idle timeout.

The GitHub Actions hydration lifecycle reuses the same machines, but lets the repository's workflow define setup:

1. `crabbox warmup` leases a reusable box and prints both a stable `cbx_...` ID and a friendly slug.
2. `crabbox actions hydrate --id blue-lobster` registers that box as an ephemeral GitHub Actions runner, dispatches the configured workflow, and waits for the workflow to write a ready marker.
3. The workflow runs normal Actions steps such as checkout, dependency install, cache/service setup, and secret-backed environment hydration.
4. `crabbox run --id blue-lobster -- <command>` syncs the local dirty checkout into the hydrated `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, sources the workflow's non-secret env handoff, and runs commands there.

Crabbox does not parse or reimplement GitHub Actions YAML. The project-owned workflow decides what to install and when the machine is ready. GitHub secrets and OIDC request tokens remain workflow-step scoped unless that workflow intentionally persists its own short-lived handoff.

Direct provider mode still exists for debugging. If no broker is configured, `--provider aws` uses the local AWS SDK credential chain and `--provider hetzner` uses `HCLOUD_TOKEN` or `HETZNER_TOKEN`. The brokered path is the default operational model.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- `git`, `ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `rsync`, and `curl`
- broker config in `~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml` or `~/Library/Application Support/crabbox/config.yaml` on macOS

Configure the deployed broker:

```sh
printf '%s' "$CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN" | \
  crabbox config set-broker \
    --url https://crabbox-coordinator.steipete.workers.dev \
    --provider aws \
    --token-stdin
```

Check local prerequisites and broker access:

```sh
crabbox doctor
```

Inspect broker config:

```sh
crabbox config show
```

Onboard a repo for Crabbox:

```sh
crabbox init
```

Warm a reusable testbox:

```sh
crabbox warmup --profile project-check --class beast
```

Hydrate that box through the repo's GitHub Actions setup, then run local tests inside the hydrated workspace:

```sh
crabbox actions hydrate --id blue-lobster
CI=1 crabbox run --id blue-lobster -- pnpm test:changed:max
```

Use AWS EC2 Spot through the broker:

```sh
crabbox warmup --class beast
```

Run a command on an existing lease:

```sh
CI=1 crabbox run --id blue-lobster -- pnpm test:changed:max
```

Inspect and connect:

```sh
crabbox status --id blue-lobster
crabbox ssh --id blue-lobster
crabbox inspect --id blue-lobster --json
```

Inspect usage and estimated cost:

```sh
crabbox usage
crabbox usage --scope org --org openclaw
crabbox usage --scope all --json
```

`crabbox usage` reads coordinator history, so it requires a configured broker. Cost is an estimate for compute leases, not a provider invoice: the coordinator prefers explicit `CRABBOX_COST_RATES_JSON` overrides, then provider pricing from AWS Spot history or Hetzner server-type prices, then built-in fallback rates. Full reference: [docs/commands/usage.md](docs/commands/usage.md).

Use the OpenClaw plugin when an agent should drive Crabbox through OpenClaw tools instead of shelling out manually. The repository root is also a native OpenClaw plugin package; install it from this repo or from a packaged release, then use the `crabbox_run`, `crabbox_warmup`, `crabbox_status`, `crabbox_list`, and `crabbox_stop` tools.

Stop a kept server:

```sh
crabbox stop blue-lobster
```

Print the CLI version:

```sh
crabbox --version
```

## Machine Classes

`beast` is the default. Hetzner uses dedicated-server classes:

```text
standard  ccx33, cpx62, cx53
fast      ccx43, cpx62, cx53
large     ccx53, ccx43, cpx62, cx53
beast     ccx63, ccx53, ccx43, cpx62, cx53
```

During verification, Hetzner rejected `ccx63`, `ccx53`, and `ccx43` because of the account dedicated-core quota, so Crabbox fell back to `cpx62`.

AWS uses flexible EC2 Spot candidate pools:

```text
standard  c7a.8xlarge, c7i.8xlarge, m7a.8xlarge, m7i.8xlarge, c7a.4xlarge
fast      c7a.16xlarge, c7i.16xlarge, m7a.16xlarge, m7i.16xlarge, c7a.12xlarge, c7a.8xlarge
large     c7a.24xlarge, c7i.24xlarge, m7a.24xlarge, m7i.24xlarge, r7a.24xlarge, c7a.16xlarge, c7a.12xlarge
beast     c7a.48xlarge, c7i.48xlarge, m7a.48xlarge, m7i.48xlarge, r7a.48xlarge, c7a.32xlarge, c7i.32xlarge, m7a.32xlarge, c7a.24xlarge, c7a.16xlarge
```

Set `CRABBOX_SERVER_TYPE` or pass `--type` to use another EC2 type such as `c8a.24xlarge`.

## Cloudflare Deployment

Worker source lives in `worker/`.

Local checks:

```sh
npm ci --prefix worker
npm run format:check --prefix worker
npm run lint --prefix worker
npm run check --prefix worker
npm test --prefix worker
npm run build --prefix worker
```

Deploy:

```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="$CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="$CRABBOX_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.jsonc
```

Required Worker secrets:

```text
HETZNER_TOKEN
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
CRABBOX_SHARED_TOKEN
```

The Worker is deployed at:

```text
https://crabbox-coordinator.steipete.workers.dev
```

The Cloudflare route `crabbox.clawd.bot/*` is also attached and currently protected by Cloudflare Access.

## OpenClaw Verification

Verified from `/Users/steipete/Projects/openclaw` on a Cloudflare-created fallback `cpx62` runner:

```sh
CI=1 /usr/bin/time -p /Users/steipete/Projects/crabbox/bin/crabbox run --id cbx_f60f47cbc879 -- pnpm test:changed:max
```

Result:

- 61 Vitest shards completed successfully.
- End-to-end warm wall time was 93.66 seconds through the Cloudflare coordinator path.
- The timing includes rsync scan, remote Git hydration, command execution, and output streaming.

For the fastest dedicated-core verification, raise the Hetzner dedicated-core quota and re-run on `ccx63`.

- `CI`

Do not pass secret values as command-line arguments. Keep provider tokens outside the repository.

## Development

Build from source:

```sh
go build -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
```

Run the local gate:

```sh
gofmt -w $(git ls-files '*.go')
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip=publish
npm ci --prefix worker
npm run format:check --prefix worker
npm run lint --prefix worker
npm run check --prefix worker
npm test --prefix worker
npm run build --prefix worker
```

CI runs the same checks on pushes and pull requests.

## Releases

Tagged pushes matching `v*` publish Go CLI archives through GoReleaser. Manual reruns can use the `release` workflow with a tag input.

GoReleaser also updates the Homebrew formula in `https://github.com/openclaw/homebrew-tap`, published to users as:

```sh
brew install openclaw/tap/crabbox
```

The release workflow needs `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` with write access to that tap repository.
