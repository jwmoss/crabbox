# Coordinator

Read when:

- changing brokered lease behavior;
- debugging coordinator auth, health, pool, status, or usage;
- deciding whether behavior belongs in the CLI or Worker.

The coordinator is the Cloudflare Worker plus Fleet Durable Object. Normal Crabbox operation goes through this broker; direct provider mode is for debugging and escape hatches.

Responsibilities:

- authenticate broker requests with the shared token and Cloudflare Access context when present;
- serialize fleet state in one Durable Object;
- create, heartbeat, release, expire, and look up leases;
- own provider credentials;
- create and delete provider resources;
- list the pool;
- enforce cost and active-lease guardrails;
- expose usage statistics.

API surface:

```text
GET  /v1/health
GET  /v1/pool
GET  /v1/whoami
POST /v1/leases
GET  /v1/leases
GET  /v1/leases/{id-or-slug}
POST /v1/leases/{id-or-slug}/heartbeat
POST /v1/leases/{id-or-slug}/release
GET  /v1/runs
POST /v1/runs
GET  /v1/runs/{run-id}
GET  /v1/runs/{run-id}/logs
POST /v1/runs/{run-id}/finish
GET  /v1/usage
GET  /v1/admin/leases
POST /v1/admin/leases/{id-or-slug}/release
POST /v1/admin/leases/{id-or-slug}/delete
```

GitHub browser-login tokens are owner/org scoped for lease, run, log, and usage routes. Shared-token admin auth is required for `GET /v1/pool`, admin lease routes, and fleet-wide usage/listing.

Lease responses include the canonical `cbx_...` ID, friendly slug when present, provider metadata, owner/org, `createdAt`, `lastTouchedAt`, `idleTimeoutSeconds`, `ttlSeconds`, and computed `expiresAt`. Heartbeat is a touch and can update idle timeout only when the request explicitly sends `idleTimeoutSeconds`.

The CLI owns local config, per-lease SSH keys, SSH readiness, sync, command execution, output streaming, and local fallback handling.
